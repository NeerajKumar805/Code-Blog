# Code-Blog

# Project Description
Code-Blog is a dynamic web application built using a combination of technologies, including Servlets, JSP, Bootstrap 5, Ajax, jQuery, MySQL database, and Apache Tomcat Server. This platform empowers users to actively engage with a community tailored for sharing and exploring content related to coding and development. Users can contribute by adding their own posts, explore content through category-wise and individual views, express preferences through likes or dislikes, and exercise control over their contributions by modifying or deleting posts. Additionally, users have the ability to perform CRUD operations on their profile details, ensuring a personalized and interactive experience within the application.
